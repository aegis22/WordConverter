# WordConverter

Program to convert text into numbers. It will always show the results in the console and also could create an output file.

# Requirements

In order to make this program, you will need:

- C++ compiler (C++14 compatible)
- CMake (> 3.14)

# Building

To make the compilation, I used Visual Studio Code with the CMake Tools plugin. Just open this repo directory, and then select the ompiler. Let the plugin do the job. To build, press F7 and select target to launch word_converter.
On the build directory you will have the executable. Run it with:

```
> word_converter -i <input_file> [-o output_file]
```
